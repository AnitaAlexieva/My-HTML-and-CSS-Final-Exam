# My-HTML-and-CSS-Final-Exam
 These are the three tasks I had to complete in my final exam at SoftUni for the HTML & CSS Basics Course

1) In the first task, I have to create a web page using HTML5 and CSS3 that looks and behaves like the screenshot they gave me. I have to use the 'Poppins' font from (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap). I need to create an 'About Us' page that has one big title, followed by two buttons ('OUR MISSION' and 'OUR VISION'). At the end, there is a little information section. On the left side, there is an image of two happy dogs, which is as big as the whole text section on the right side.

2) In the second task, I am given an unresponsive website (HTML + CSS + images) and I have to make the site responsive. The site layout should change according to the browser viewport / screen size. I need to implement 1 layout: width <= 600px.

3) In the third task, I have to create a complete web page using HTML5 and CSS3. The page's header section contains three different types of navigation: text, icons, and main navigation. In the header-main section, there is one big heading, a smaller heading, and a button to learn more. In the main section, there are two articles, each with a 'Learn more' button, and between them, there is an image of an ice cream. The footer includes icon navigation, contact information, and a paragraph about rights.
